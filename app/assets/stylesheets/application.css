 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 *= require_self
 # 会把 application.css 这个文件中的 CSS 也加载进来。
 *= require_tree .
 # 会把 app/assets/stylesheets 目录中的所有 CSS 文件都引入应用程序的样式表中。
